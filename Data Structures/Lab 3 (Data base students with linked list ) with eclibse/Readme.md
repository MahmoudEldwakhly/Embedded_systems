# Student Database with Linked List

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a simple student database using a linked list in C. The database allows for the addition, deletion, viewing, and deletion of all student records. The project was developed using the Eclipse IDE.

## Key Learning Outcomes

### 1. **Linked List Implementation**
   - **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Utilized `malloc` and `free` to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory for student records.
   - **Pointer Manipulation:** Managed pointers effectively to navigate through and modify the linked list structure.
   - **Insertion and Deletion:** Developed functions to insert new student records into the list and delete specific records by ID, ensuring proper memory management.

### 2. **File I/O and String Handling**
   - **User Input Handling:** Used functions like `gets` and `atoi` to read and convert user input, allowing for the creation of dynamic student records.
   - **Data Conversion:** Converted strings to integers and floats for processing student IDs and heights.

### 3. **Error Handling and Debugging**
   - **Build Error Resolution:** Encountered and resolved file access permission issues during the build process in Eclipse, learning how to troubleshoot common build errors.
   - **Debugging:** Used the Eclipse IDE’s debugging tools to step through the code, identifying and fixing logical errors.

### 4. **Eclipse IDE Proficiency**
   - **Project Setup:** Gained experience in setting up and managing a C project within the Eclipse IDE, including configuring the build process and handling build errors.
   - **Code Management:** Improved skills in organizing and managing C code files within a larger project structure.

## How to Use

1. **Add Student:** Allows for the addition of a new student to the database. The user is prompted to input the student’s ID, name, and height.
2. **Delete Student:** Removes a student from the database by matching the provided ID.
3. **View Students:** Displays all student records currently stored in the database.
4. **Delete All:** Removes all student records from the database.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Language:** C
- **IDE:** Eclipse
- **Libraries:** Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`)

## Conclusion

Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of managing linked lists in C, handling memory dynamically, and troubleshooting build issues in an IDE environment. This project provided practical experience in working with low-level data structures and the intricacies of memory management in C.

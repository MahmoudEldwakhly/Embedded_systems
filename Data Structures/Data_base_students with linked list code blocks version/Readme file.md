# Student Database Management with Linked List

## Overview
This project involves creating and managing a simple student database using a linked list in C. The program allows users to add, delete, view, and delete all student records. Each student record contains an ID, name, and height.

## Key Learnings

### 1. **Linked List Operations**
   - **Insertion**: Implemented functionality to add new student records to the linked list. This involved creating new nodes and ensuring they were correctly linked to the existing list.
   - **Deletion**: Developed the ability to delete specific student records by ID, requiring traversal of the list and careful handling of pointers to maintain the integrity of the list.
   - **Traversal**: Implemented a function to view all student records, which involved traversing the entire linked list and accessing the data within each node.
   - **Deletion of All Nodes**: Learned how to safely delete all nodes in the linked list, ensuring that all dynamically allocated memory was properly freed to avoid memory leaks.

### 2. **Pointer Manipulation**
   - Gained experience with pointers, which are essential for managing dynamic data structures like linked lists in C.
   - Practiced pointer arithmetic and understood how to manipulate pointers to navigate through the list and manage node connections.

### 3. **Dynamic Memory Management**
   - Applied dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` to create new nodes in the linked list.
   - Ensured proper memory management by freeing memory when nodes are deleted to prevent memory leaks.

### 4. **Debugging and Error Handling**
   - Debugged the program to fix issues related to incorrect pointer usage and memory allocation.
   - Implemented basic error handling to manage cases where operations on the list might fail, such as trying to delete a non-existent student.

### 5. **Practical Application**
   - This task provided hands-on experience with linked lists, a fundamental data structure in computer science, and reinforced understanding of how data structures are implemented and managed in C.
   - The project also highlighted the importance of careful memory management in systems programming, which is critical for developing efficient and reliable software.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my skills in C programming, particularly in the areas of data structures, memory management, and debugging. The experience gained from working on this task is valuable for developing more complex data structures and memory management techniques in future projects.
